This project is aimed towards helping friends cook together. Each user has a kitchen of ingredients and utensils. Together, users can plan meals based on their pooled ingredients using the Recipe Puppy api. This api searches for recipes given a set of ingredients they should contain.

To use this, first create an account and then go to your friends page and start adding friends (click on them from the all users section). Once friends have been added, click on "Start a Botluck" on the right nav bar. Once you have started the botluck, it will take you to the meal page where the planning and recipe gathering takes place. Once your friends haev accepted their requests, they will be added to the meal. When the meal has been eaten, the meal will be deleted and go into your history of meals.
