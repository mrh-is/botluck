This project is aimed towards helping friends cook together. Each user has a kitchen of ingredients and utensils. Together, users can plan meals based on their pooled ingredients using the Recipe Puppy api. This api searches for recipes given a set of ingredients they should contain. When a user contributes ingredients toward a meal, they earn karma points. The freeloaders know who they are!

To use Botluck, first create an account and then go to your "my friends" page and start addinsg friends (click on them from the "all users" section to add them to your friend list). Once you've added some friends, click on "Start a Botluck" on the right nav bar.  Fill out the page with the requested info and then send invitations.

After sending invitations, you will be redirected to the meal page, where the collaborative planning and recipe gathering takes place. Once your friends have accepted their requests, they will be added to the meal page, and the recipe suggestions will update based on the collective pool of ingredients that all the members of the meal have.  Friends can "like" certain recipes, but only the meal creator can select the meal recipe, by clicking on it and then committing the choice by clicking on the "choose recipe" button.

After the meal has been eaten, the meal will be deleted and go into your history of meals.

To edit your kitchen, click on "my kitchen" in the nav bar.  From there you can add and remove ingredients and utensils.
